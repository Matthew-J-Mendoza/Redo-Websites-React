        Review: "In a long line series of Jojo Bizarre Adventure where each part centers around a member of the Joesrtar bloodline, Part 5, or Golden Wind, centers around the character Giornno Giovana who is decendant of the Jostars bloodline and by the main antagonist of Part 1 and Part 3, but an explanation would be to long about how this happened. In this point of time of Golden Wind, the power system of Stands has been introduced 2 parts ago in which those who posses great wills can obtain a spirit that has a unique power and various stats, based on the user called Stand. The story takes place in Italy where the whole country is ruled by a mob and there is a rampant drug problem. Giorno wishes to become what he calls a “Gangstar” by taking over the mob and getting rid of the drug trade. He meets with a leader of Passione named Bucciarati, who believes in the same ideal has Giorno and you watch their journey of climbing the ranks to over throw the Boss whose identity is unknown and posses a power that’s allows him to maintain anonymity.When this anime aired, I fell in love with the story and the main message of the overarching story. Through out the story, you’ll hear a lot about resolve whenever the characters are in a dire situation in which sacrifices need to be mad for victory such as getting shot by your own reflected bullets to drive a guy in a sharp piece of metal through his breathing hole of his suit that’s invincible or splitting yourself apart and including your heart so the enemy can’t detect your presence. The story also revolves around the idea of fate and at first one would think that it was to oppose it, but later on it’s clear that fate can’t be altered. As depressing as that sounds, the story instead tells the message of by continuous effort, one can strive for a better future/ fate. What I mean by this is that by taking fate head on, such as never running away from hardship, one can make an impact on their own and other’s lives, and I feel like that’s a vey inspiring message and the story gives examples of those who skipped the process and what their fates are."

        Review: "Oh man, where to start on this show. Rooster Teeth’s new 3D animated “anime” was pretty widely well received when it showed its first trailer. The “Red” trailer is an amazing display of why I love RWBY. It’s a crazy action packed fight between the titular character Ruby and a large group of monsters. The combo of smooth animations, smooth camera work, and outstanding music all come together to give us what RWBY will be most known for. The fights in rwby are really cool, but what about the rest of the show? Thats where the grab bag comes that kills the show for most people. The first 2 seasons are, with exception of the fight scenes, are objectively bad. However, the character designs and relatively nice flow of story works for the web series style this show is trying to give. In season 3 onwards the episodes are of similar length and the real drama begins. Even after the lead animator that handled all of the amazing fight scenes passed away, the fights are good and continue to improve. It’s a good show, give it a try."

        Review: "I’m sure you know about Naruto and Naruto Shipuden. Recently people have been giving it flack for some of its plot points and character development, but it remains one of my favorite animes. The story is amazing and hits almost perfect emotional beats throughout the show. Even the filler has a chance for a good story and fight scenes. I'm sure you will find, as you read my reviews, that I adore fight scenes of all different kinds. And let me tell you, the fights in Naruto are fast, fluid, and mostly well thought out with cool tricks and moves that the characters use to gain the upper hand on each other. Just the first fight with the first villain, Zabuza is a force to be reckoned with. Very cool show, very nice action."

        Review: "As I wrote these reviews I realized that all of my favorite shows are crazy action shounens with aliens, monsters, and explosions. So what is this stupid cutsy anime slice of life doing here? Well this show is a little bit more than that. I haven't watched a lot of anime, but the twist in this show is something I haven't ever seen. Its about this group of girls who are surviving the zombie apocalypse in a floor of their school. Pretty average start, but the twist is that the main character must have her illusion of a normal world maintained or she stops to function. No eating, talking, or sleeping as long as she is like that. I cant go too much into this show without spoiling much but it's good. Go watch it."

        Review: "Widely considered one of, if not the best animes to ever come out. No hundreds of episodes, no missed plot points, and no waiting. This anime takes almost every second to build up the story and characters with just the right amount of mystery. The action is fun and creative as well this show’s power system, Alchemy. The characters are great and under-go amazing character arcs. The themes touched in this show are great too. This show not only has amazing animation and story beats, but also amazing music. Go look up The Intrepid from the show. It's practically a masterpiece. Its a great show, go watch it. Stop grading this and watch it."

        Review: "Oh man, Dragon Ball, the start of the typical shonen anime. That being my favorite genre it's no surprise it's somewhere on this list. Dragon Ball is pretty typical and plays into the stereotypes that a lot of shonen fall into nowadays. The difference being that this show invented those stereotypes and does them in a way that, for the most part, is inoffensive. The long drawn out power up sequences, arbitrary numbers and move names, and villians that are unapologetically evil all add to the charm of this show. All the iconic moments that most people already know about are effective again and again when you watch it. The characters have surprisingly in depth character arcs and also have some spots of great music in there, mostly accompanying the times when the fight scenes really start rolling. The fights have some amazing spectacle that has been copied time and time again in other shows. It's a good show, go watch it."

        Review: "Hunter x Hunter is something I can’t fit into one box. It goes from a campy show of a boy with a dream who make friends with powerful people who overcome challenges through the power of friendship, then to a season long tournament arch with a new ability introduced, a revenge story, a yu-gi-oh  like show where the characters must collect all the cards, and then an arc about ants and the question of character’s morality. It’s such a wild ride of show with ending songs that always gets you hyped to watch the next episode such as “Hunting for Your Dreams” for example. The music amazing also, especially in the final season. I think what I like most are the fights which are similar to JoJo’s fights where it’s not about how strong one is all the time, but it’s about strategies and characters being creative with their abilities or what they have on hand. The final season is great in it own right, but I won’t spoil it, but if you enjoy the first few seasons, this will be the cherry on top for sure. I recommend anyone who’s into anime in general to check this out."

        Review: "This show takes place in a world where humanity had been forced to live underground for an unknown reason, but only know that the surface was dangerous. This story follows Simon who is a digger that creates new areas for his underground village and is someone with not a lot of self-confidence. Along side him is the embodiment of “masculinity” himself Kamina, who serves as mentor for Simon as he’s not afraid to take on the challenge head. They end up finding their way to the surface with a small mech called gunmans and find out the surface is running rampant by these gunamans, controlled by beastmen who’s goal is to keep humanity down. This becomes a story becomes the journey of Simon becoming a man and to believe in the Simon that he himself believes in. One can think of this as the more optimistic Evangelion where both main characters are reluctant to fight the enemy in each episode and struggle with self-worth, but without the psychological horror. It tells a message that one isn’t stuck to being who they are, but they can become the person they believe in. This show is about revolution, but I think it’s about asserting who you really are can be by the catch phrase of Kamina, “Just who the hell do you think I am.” We see this with Simon where he grows from being scared and leaving things to others to someone like Kamina, taking control and is driven to move forward."

        Review: "Dr.Stone takes place in a world where all of humanity has been petrified by a green ray of light that covered the entire world and for over three thousand years, humanity was absent, until the main character named Senku, a teen who can be best described as a mad scientist with a heart, breaks from his petrification and later free’s his friend Taiju who is the bronze to Senku’s brains. Their goal is not only to restart humanity and free the world from petrification, but to advance technology beyond that of humanity prior to the mass petrification. Throughout the story, they have make science projects to overcome situations and enemies such as in the first part of Dr.Stone where they revive the world’s strongest high schooler who one shotted a lion not even one minute after being revived, but he turns out to be someone who wants to create a world without science so that sins of humanity won’t corrupt this new world. Everything in the series is all according to science (except the petrification beam) and the series does give steps how to craft whatever Senku and friends are making, even gunpowder, which the show does make obvious to never do if you’re not a professional. With science being the main power system, this show makes you hyped about certain aspects of science such as when Senku and friends work to create an antibiotic pill for a whole arc. Overall a great series to check out."

        Review: "In Death Note, it’s a story of a teen name Light who happens to find a notebook called the Death Note, which can kill anyone who’s name is written in it. He then decides to use it to reform the world using this tool and become the god of the new world. The fun part of the series is that while Light is on his high, he gets played by a intelligent detective by the name of L who was able to locate his general area via broadcast and learns that Light needs a name to kill and so, L keeps his identity hidden. This then begins the cat and mouse game between Light and L to see who can figure out who’s identity first. If you like dramas, I’d recommend this show to you."

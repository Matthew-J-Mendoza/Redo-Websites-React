        Review: "Unfortunately the only Dark Souls game that I have played. However this game is still one of the greatest that I have played. This game mostly runs off of the atmosphere that it gives off and the gameplay loop that reinforces that atmosphere. This game, from the start, gives you a feeling of dread, despair, darkness, hopelessness, and the feeling that you, as the player character, are nothing to this world. That doesn't sound like that much fun at all, but the game presents all of those negative factors as a challenge. Will you give into this despair and hopelessness and refuse to explore the game? Will you let that game tell you that you are nothing, or will you go defeat the lords of cinder? Its up to you to find your favorite way of fighting the dregs of this world and continue (or end) this twisted world.",

        Review: "Made by the wonderful studio From Software, this game is the mixture of Dark Souls and H.P. Lovecraft works. To summarize, Bloodborne takes place in a Town called Yarnahm, which became a place that everyone came from around the world to visit for its healing blood that was discovered in old tombs found underground and sapped from the corpses called The Old Ones which are celestial beings you encounter later in the game. As with all good things, there is also a price. What ends up happening is that people begin to turn into beasts and thus a hunt was introduced to rid the town of beasts, but people got lost in the hunt and become insane and attack anyone. At this time, time you had just gotten the blood treatment for unknown reasons, but you sign a contract for your healing which can’t not be avoided by death as you are brought back to this world upon death. This contract is with this dream like area called the Workshop where the first hunter resides and ask of you to hunt beasts and the celestials that have the world under their grip, to put and end to the everlasting night. This game brings fast paced gameplay that is encouraged by the Resolve system where upon taking damage, you can strike back to get that health back without any healing items. You will traverse this gothic town, facing the horrors of this world and beyond as you fight powerful celestial beings that humans can’t comprehend without enough insight which is something you can increase and you’ll be able notice things you never seen before. It’s also full of difficulty, so don’t expect to be sightseeing. If you like the Souls series and or want another challenging game, this is the one, but only to those with a PlayStation 4 as this is an exclusive to this console.",

        Review: "A third-person shooter, over the top action, mmo with space ninjas? Yes, please! Warframe plays essentially like a shooter version of Diablo, where you move around and kill hordes of enemies in a room with side objectives, such as defending a cryopod, or sneaking into an ifo room. There are alot of different characters, called “Warframes,” that have many different sets of powers that you can freely choose between. After some farming of course. The satisfaction of mowing down hordes of enemies is a common gameplay loop that is used very well in Warframe. The melee combat is especially fun. It have a simple combo system and a heavy attack system that sets it apart from other games. The real difference in Warframe is the modding system. Your Warframes and weapons gain little to no power from leveling up. Instead you gain more mod space to slot in more mods. This is where the real power increase is from. It’s fun, go play it.",

        Review: "In this game, you traverse a randomly generated block world fill with various biomes such as the great plains, jungles, deserts and even mushroom islands. As the name entails, you are to mine and craft new items to help out in your endeavors. Your main goal is to find a way to the ender world and slay the ender dragon. This involves upgrading your tools, jumping into hell itself called the Nether, and finding the fortress where the portal resides, but you need to fill the slots around it to activate it. For people like me, I like the survival aspect and building. Beyond the main quest, you can just focus on building a house or even a village for a matter a fact, build automated machines via Redstone, or even explore the world and see what’s out there. You can encounter jungle temples, desert temples, enemy towers, a huge mansion, mineshafts, and villages where you can trade with the villagers for goods or for emeralds, which is the currency in this game. For those who are creative, you can start a world with no mobs and go into creative mode where you can build to your hearts content without having to grab resources outside of your menu. I think I’d recommend this game to those who are creative and or want to relax as you build your house and advance through the game.",

        Review: "I couldn't make a list like this without Risk of Rain 2. (RoF2) It is a 3d, third-person shooter, rouge-like. RoF2 has you crash on a hostile planet where you fight for your life, and use the ships cargo scattered around the planet to become stronger. Similar to Warframe, the act of getting strong enough to obliterate large groups of enemies is super satisfying. This games mobility upgrades are lots of fun too, and crucial to your survival in the later game. As you fight your way through a part of a planet you need to find a teleporter. You can then activate the teleporter to start the teleporter event. In the event a boss spawns and a bubble appears around the teleporter. You must kill the boss and stay within the bubble for a certain amount of time for the teleporter to activate and move on to the next level. Its much easier said than done with RoF2’s enemy lineup and random modifiers to those enemies. There are also a lot of fun secrets to find to add more items to the game or increase your power for that run. Its a fun game, go play it.",

        Review: "Have you looked at a FIFA game and wondered how can one innovate soccer as a game, both developer companies Psyonix and Panic Button Games, answered with rockets and RC cars. In rocket league game where you play against other players and the goal is the hit a hug ball with your car into each other’s goals. On the surface, this may sound bland, but with rocket boosts this not only makes the game more fast paced, it allows for amazing plays by ariel shots where you can shift the angle and direction of your car in the air to fly in the air, but it does take some skill to master. Luckily, the player only has a limited amount of boost to keep the game from being to crazy, but they can replenish it by hitting theses orange areas of light. The game also allows the player to customize their cars by changing the model, color (two color types for the teams of blue and orange), antenna on your car and hats. What I like most that they are partnered with my favorite music company Monstercat which is based around EDM. I’d say if you’re looking for a game to be skilled at, this is the game.",

        Review: "A classic tab-target MMO with a few twists. Its classes, called professions, all have quite simple movesets, but can switch weapons to get more abilities. Say a thief, Guild Wars assassin class, can use two daggers for a stealth style backstabbing class, or they can equip a sword and pistol to become a quick, dodging and teleporting fighter. On top of that all classes can switch to one other weapon set while still in combat with a press of a button. It's got a surprising amount of depth to it. Other than that its got a much more mobile fighting loop than other tab targeting MMO’s. First you have a dodge button which makes you dash a short distance and makes you dodge ALL attacks made to you for that dash. Not only that but many classes have mobility tied into their kits as well. A profession called “Guardian” may seem like a large slow-moving tank, but when armed with a straight sword he can teleport and smite enemies. Guild Wars also makes an attempt to remove the typical trifecta of “dps,” ”tank,” and”healer.” Take the thief again, it is a great dps class, but it can also tank though its agro taking and dodging abilities, and support with its venoms that heal and buffs other players. It's a fun game, go play it.",

        Review: "The story follows the character named Delsin who lives in a world where there are people called Conduits who can manipulate certain elements such as smoke, neon, concrete, electricity, and even the power of video. Conduits in this world are seen as a danger to society and must be locked up. This is enforced by the organization called the D.U.P. which is ironically use the conduit powers of concrete, given to them by the leader via intense DNA altercation. Delsin, after an encounter with a conduit, discovers that he has the conduit ability to copy any conduits he makes contact with. Through the story, you aim to overthrow the D.U.P. to free conduits form Seattle, for the good or the worst.",

        Review: "Nier Automata can be the story about what it means to be human and the war between androids created by humans, to fight the machines which were sent by aliens to take over earth. You play as the character 2B along with her partner 9S, who are sent from Yorhah, name of the collective of androids, to investigate the mysterious behavior of the machines. You’ll encounter many groups of machines, each of them attempting to replicate a certain aspect of humanity such as reproducing, love, philosophy, monarchy, and religion. As you play, you will uncover secrets that show you what’s really happening and that everything is not as it seems. I would talk about the second part of the story, but that’s where the game really starts and I don’t want to spoil the experience. In my opinion, this is the best game to come out in recent years. Everything in this game is not how you expect it such as the gameplay, the story, and the fact that this game is based on an alternate ending to Drakengard, a fantasy game. The gameplay varies from moment such as it will sometime be a fighter, beat-em up, twin-stick shooter, old styled shooter where you can only aim in from of you on a sliding screen, and even a fighting game at two points in the story. The way that this story is set up, can only work with in this medium as You will play the first story twice, form two different perspectives before getting to the second part and there are a lot of twists in it. Another thing I love about this game is the endings that are listed form 1-25 with a letter from the alphabet being highlighted which was the goal of the creator. Some of those endings are for the story, but the rest are joke endings. Depending on the mission or quest, there’s certain things you can do to trigger a joke ending. One example is when you are offered to eat fish for an experiment and if you accept, it will trigger an ending where the oils mess up you systems and you die, but not before enjoying the taste. Other examples include running away from critical moments where you need to do something urgent to progress the story and you ‘ll get endings about how your character went insane.",

        Review: "Destiny is amazing. There has to be something about this game that everyone can enjoy. Whether it's the amazing smooth gunplay from the creators of the Halo trilogy, the great story told in the Grimoire cards found around the game, or the tests of skill in raids or ranked pvp modes. The art style is beautiful, from the space fantasy dreamscape that is the Dreaming City, to the amazing stilted research centers of the Solarium on the moon Titan. Everything you look at seems to have a story and depth to it. Sometimes it is great just to sit and look at the skyboxes. If that's not your style then becoming a gunslinging, space magic using, destructive force known as a guardian. All of the guardian classes are fun and have great ways of playing them. All weapons feel great to use, and exotic ones feel powerful. There are multiple enemy alien races that all have unique art styles, abilities, and feeling to fighting them. I could talk more about this great game, but it's getting long so I'll stop here. It's a good game, go play it.",
